Nagaya gives 6 places, I however would reduced the phonemic places of articulation to 4.

The same holds for the alveo-palatal place of articulation (for /dʒ/). In this case, the phonetic articulation is reported to be alveo-palatal but I could imaging that it migth also be articulated alveolarly, as this is for example the case in neighbouring Hewa.
